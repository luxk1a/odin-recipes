    <h2>Description </h2>
<p> 
    A sword is a melee weapon that is mainly used to damage entities and for cutting cobwebs or bamboo (resulting in twice the normal damage being taken).
    A sword is made from one of six materials, in order of increasing quality and expense: wood, gold, stone, iron, diamond and netherite.
    This recipe will focus on the diamond variant.
